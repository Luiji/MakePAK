People
======

Pete McCormick <petra@force.net>: Provided documentation on the .PAK format.
Note that the contents of 'FORMAT' were NOT written by Pete McCormick.

Ryan C. Gordon <icculus@icculus.org>: Answered many questions I had about the
.PAK format and helped me determine what was wrong with the outputted .PAK files
early on in development.

Projects
========

Gnulib <http://gnu.org/software/gnulib>: Provides tons of super awesome
functions and portability helpers.

GNU Hello <http://gnu.org/software/hello>: For providing information on how to
make a GNU Package (although this is not a GNU Package, the information was used
to properly integrate Gnulib and the Autotools).

PhysicsFS <http://icculus.org/physfs/>: For providing a library for reading the
.PAK files that were being outputted to make sure they were actually readable.
